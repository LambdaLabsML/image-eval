# Prompts

Two prompt sources:
* [VBENCH](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/blob/master/prompts/all_category.txt) prompts sample
* [Popular prompts](./popular_prompts.txt) used to demo commercial models including RunwayML Gen-2, Meta Make-A-Video, Google Phenaki, and Sora by OpenAI


Note:
* Both source pre-date opensora training potentially so we need to trust that the OpenSora team didnt contaminate training with these sources.
* While it provides a good first step, we should use our own set of prompt to guarantee never seen before, uncontaminated validation data.
